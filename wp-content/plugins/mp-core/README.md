# [MP Core](https://mintplugins.com/plugins/mp-core/) 

### Welcome to our GitHub Repository

MP Core is a plugin for developers which contains a group of classes and functions used to power plugins and themes. The idea here is keeping all the code that we re-use over and over, and keeping it in one place so it never needs to be re-written - saving time and being efficient.

More information can be found at [mintplugins.com/plugins/mp-core/](https://mintplugins.com/plugins/mp-core/).
